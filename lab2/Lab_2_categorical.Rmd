Title
Task 1: Identification and Comparative Analysis of Probability Distributions for Categorical Data
Task 2: Simulation Study Demonstrating Consistency of the MLE for Poisson Distribution


Objectives
Task 1
Identify all probability distributions applicable to categorical data.

Provide detailed descriptions and compare their properties and use cases.

Task 2
Simulate Poisson data for various sample sizes.

Estimate the Poisson rate parameterùúÜ using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).

Demonstrate that the estimator is consistent through simulation.


 Methodology
Task 1
Techniques: Survey of discrete probability distributions used for categorical data

Assumptions: Variables are either nominal or ordinal.

Task 2
Techniques: Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

Estimator for Poisson:

ùúÜ^ MLE = X bar

Assumptions:

Observations are independent

Data follows Poisson distribution

Software: R




Task 1:
Thoroughly identify every probability distribution applicable to categorical data in statistics,assembling detailed information on each, and provide a comparative analysis of these distributions.

1. Bernoulli Distribution

Definition: Models a single trial with two outcomes (success/failure, yes/no)
Parameter: p: probability of success 
Practical Use Cases:
Medical Testing: A patient either has a disease or doesn‚Äôt.

Marketing: Whether a customer clicks on an ad (click = 1, no click = 0)

Quality Control: A product is either defective or not.


 2. Binomial Distribution
üîπ Definition: Repeated Bernoulli trials ‚Äî models number of successes in ùëõ independent binary trials.
Practical Use Cases:
Manufacturing: Out of 100 items, how many are defective?

Elections: Out of 1,000 voters, how many support candidate A?

Clinical Trials: Number of patients who respond positively to a drug out of 50.


3. Categorical (Multinoulli) Distribution
üîπ Definition: One trial with more than two possible categories.
Practical Use Cases:
Survey: A person selects one favorite cuisine from [Indian, Chinese, Italian, Mexican].

Customer Support: Reason for contacting (Billing, Tech Support, Shipping).

Marketing: Ad campaign click leads to one of several actions (purchase, signup, exit).


 4. Multinomial Distribution
üîπ Definition: Generalization of binomial where each trial can result in more than two outcomes, over multiple trials.

Practical Use Cases:
Political Polling: Out of 1,000 respondents, how many support each of 4 parties?

Retail: Count of purchases per product category over a week.

Call Center: Number of calls per issue type over a day.








Task 2:
Simulate Poisson data of increasing sample sizes, estimate Œª using its MLE, and show‚Äîthrough a brief simulation study‚Äîthat this estimator is consistent.

Data Description
Source: Simulated using rpois() in R

Distribution Used: Poisson with true Œª = 4.5

Variable: Count data representing number of events (e.g., customers/hour)

Sample Sizes: 25, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 100000

```{r}
set.seed(123)
lambda_true = 4.5
sample_sizes = c(25, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 100000)
lambda_mle_values = numeric(length(sample_sizes))

for (i in seq_along(sample_sizes)) {
  x <- rpois(sample_sizes[i], lambda_true)
  lambda_mle_values[i] = mean(x)
}

result = data.frame(Sample_Size = sample_sizes, MLE_Lambda = lambda_mle_values)
print(result)

plot(sample_sizes, lambda_mle_values, type = "b", col = "blue", pch = 19,
     xlab = "Sample Size", ylab = "MLE of Lambda",
     main = "Consistency of MLE for Poisson Distribution")
abline(h = lambda_true, col = "red", lty = 2)

```

The red dashed line is the true value ùúÜ=4.5

The blue dots and line show the estimated Œª values.

At small sample sizes, the estimates vary a lot.

As the sample size increases, the estimates stabilize and get closer to 4.5, showing that the MLE is consistent.
