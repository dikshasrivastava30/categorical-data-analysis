1.Explain the three types of Chi-square tests and when to apply Fisher’s Exact Test.

A. Chi-Square Tests:
There are three main types of Chi-square tests:

1. Chi-Square Test for Goodness-of-Fit

Purpose: Checks if the observed distribution fits an expected distribution.

Used when: You have one categorical variable with multiple levels and want to test how well your observed counts fit expected proportions.

Example: Testing if a die is fair (expected each face to appear 1/6 of the time).

2. Chi-Square Test for Independence

Purpose: Checks if two categorical variables are independent (no association).

Used when: You have data in a contingency table (cross-tabulation).

Example: Checking if gender is independent of disease status (Yes/No).

3. Chi-Square Test for Homogeneity

Purpose: Compares the distribution of a categorical variable across multiple groups.

Used when: You want to compare proportions across different populations.

Example: Testing if different regions have the same distribution of blood types.

Difference between Independence and Homogeneity:
Both use contingency tables, but:

Independence: Same population, two variables.

Homogeneity: Multiple populations, one variable.

B. Fisher’s Exact Test
Purpose: Tests for association between two categorical variables in a 2×2 contingency table.

Used when:

Sample size is small (especially when any cell count < 5).

Chi-square test assumptions are violated.

Example: Testing if a new drug has a significant effect vs. placebo in a small clinical trial.




2.Identify a real-world medical situation where McNemar’s test is applicable. Apply the test framework and write the conclusion.

Scenario:
A hospital tests the effectiveness of a new rapid diagnostic test compared to the standard method on the same patients.

100 patients are tested using both methods (before and after, or method A vs. method B).

Goal: Check if there is a significant change in detection results between the two methods.

```{r}
# Create a 2x2 contingency table representing the counts of symptom relief outcomes
data = matrix(c(40, 10, 25, 25), nrow = 2,
               dimnames = list("Standard Test" = c("Positive", "Negative"),
                               "New Test" = c("Positive", "Negative")))

# Display the contingency table
print("Contingency table:")
print(data)

# Perform McNemar's Test with continuity correction
result_with_correction = mcnemar.test(data)
print("McNemar's Test with continuity correction:")
print(result_with_correction)

# Perform McNemar's Test without continuity correction
result_without_correction = mcnemar.test(data, correct = FALSE)
print("McNemar's Test without continuity correction:")
print(result_without_correction)
```
